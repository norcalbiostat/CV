# Teaching 

I teach the Intro and Applied Statistics courses for majors and non-majors, as well as an Intro and Advanced Data Science course at Chico State. Most of my course materials are available on my website: www.norcalbiostat.com. 

In addition to teaching traditional courses, I occasionally teach reproducible research and data analysis skills using R at workshops.
